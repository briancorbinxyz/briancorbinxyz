I'm Brian - A lifetime tinkerer and creative and enterprising Software Solutions Architect, Engineering Manager and Technical Product Owner with over two decades of experience across the software industry (+a decade more coding and hacking for fun!). My love for technology got its start after tinkering with code in BASIC as a child in the UK on a Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and RM Nimbus.
