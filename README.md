I'm Brian - A lifetime creator, tinkerer, and software engineer with extensive experience across the software industry and finance for investment banking (+plenty more coding and hacking for fun!). My love for technology got its start after tinkering with code in BASIC as a child in the UK on a Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and RM Nimbus.

### Mission
Ask Maya Angelou:
