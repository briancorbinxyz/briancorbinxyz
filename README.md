A lifetime tinkerer and creative and enterprising Software Solutions Architect, Engineering Manager and Technical Product Owner with 20+ years of industry experience (+10 more hacking for fun!) and a proven track record of excellence in the field. My love for technology got its start after tinkering with code as a child in the UK on a Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and RM Nimbus.
